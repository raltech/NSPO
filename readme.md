# Neuromodulation Stimulus Pattern Optimization

## Abstract
Epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by abnormal brain activity leading to seizures, affects over 50 million people globally, according to WHO. While medication is the primary treatment, some patients are drug-resistant, necessitating alternative interventions such as neuromodulation, an approach that utilizes electrical stimulation of the brain to suppress seizures. FDA-approved Responsive Neurostimulation System (RNS) by NeuroPace is one such neuromodulation device, which uses eight electrodes to stimulate the neuronal population involved in seizure suppression.

However, the optimization of neuromodulation is challenging due to the intricate network of neuronal interconnections, cost per evaluation, and constraints on stimulus quantity. This project presents an experiment framework for applying optimization algorithms to a biologically accurate model of a neuronal population to find optimal stimulation patterns under safety constraints. The computational model is designed using the Brian 2 Python package for simulating spiking neural networks, along with the Hodgkin-Huxley model to simulate neuron dynamics.

A neuron network of eight neurons and electrodes, consistent with the RNS system, is utilized. Four test cases are evaluated based on different network configurations and target response patterns. Optimization techniques, including genetic algorithms and the cross-entropy method (which do not require gradient information), are used to simulate responses to varying input stimuli. These algorithms were tested against the test cases for 20 iterations, with results averaged over five runs.

Results show that while both algorithms were able to produce desired response patterns, the cross-entropy method outperformed genetic algorithms in most cases. Future work includes broadening parameter space, such as considering duration and timing of stimulus onset, and exploring more complex neuron and synapse structures. However, these future directions would require significantly more computational resources. This project offers promising steps towards improved epilepsy management through optimized neuromodulation.
